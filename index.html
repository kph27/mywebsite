                            <p>A boy named Prabhath was happy and joyful 20years old. His day starts with a beautiful smile and sunshine through his window. He loves his own company with music and morning tea. Everyday after his daily routine , he goes to his balcony along with his phone and headphones listening  to some good music and passing time watching the beautiful moments from his balcony. </p>
                            <p>The day he saw a cute puppy….
                                One fine day Prabhath saw a cute puppy playing with his mother. It was a street dog, but was very healthy ,the black fur of the dog was very attractive . Keeping the phone aside watching that puppy Smile , he had joy in his heart. He went on the road to see the puppy closer. It was more cute than he expected. Puppy was busy playing with his mother. He started thinking, why can’t I adopt and make it as my pet. His eyes turned towards his mother and laughed because he knew if he takes the puppy the mother will not leave him. He was laughing and starring the cute puppy. Then he thought okay, I can’t take this puppy home .He started to think a name for the puppy.  What can I name this? Blacky? Teddy? Snoopy? No wait! let’s think something  unique, searching in google in his phone reading the names.. max, kobe, Oscar, cooper, mac, Charlie, simba? Simbaaaa! nice.. getting the lion king in his mind. To the puppy “Hi! Simba!!!”  He went to the store and brought some food to Simba and his mother. Later he fed him and spent some good moments with Simba and went back to his home.  </p>

                            <di class="text">Simba’s first rain.</di>
                            <p>Next day, as a daily routine he came to his balcony with a cup of tea, it was a lovely weather  it was about to rain, pleasant music  in his ears. And it started drizzling. Enjoying the tea he got his sight on that cute puppy, Simba. He  smiled looking at him. Simba was a very small puppy barely a month or two old. Simba was watching the sky, thinking  from where this water is coming from? The smell of soil was very satisfying. It started raining. Simba’s mother took him and hide him inside a nearby autorickshaw. With the music in his ears he was enjoying the rain. After couple of hours rain stopped. Water droplets on the leaves, shining more than glitters. Simba came out  running in the water and was enjoying  playing with the leaves. Prabhath kept his phone aside and went to Simba with some food, fed him and his mother. Simba was wagging his tail fast and was watching him. Spending sometime with the cute puppy, he went up to his balcony to get his mobile to take some snaps of Simba. Simba looks more cute in the pictures. He went back to his room saying bye to Simba. Rain, Simba, Music and chai made his day.</p>
